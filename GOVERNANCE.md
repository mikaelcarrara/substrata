# Token Governance

**Executive summary**  
This document defines policies, responsibilities, and procedures to ensure Substrata operates as the **Single Source of Truth** for visual design decisions. It includes principles, change processes, recommended CI jobs, practical templates, and success metrics. Copy this content to `Governance.md` in the canonical repository.

---

## Core principles and policies

- **Tokens as contracts**: tokens are stable contracts between design and code; value changes are breaking by default.  
- **Single source of truth**: the canonical repository is the only authorized place to edit tokens.  
- **Semantic versioning**: adopt **semver**; breaking changes require a major version bump.  
- **Auditability and traceability**: all changes must go through a PR with justification, changelog entry, and assigned owner.  
- **Mandatory human review**: critical changes require approval from the category owners.

---

## Roles and responsibilities

- **Category owners**
  - **Colors** — palette and semantic aliases  
  - **Typography** — typographic scales and related tokens  
  - **Spacing** — spacing scale  
  - **Motion, Elevation, Opacity, Breakpoints** — owners for their respective domains  

- **Integration team** — maintains export pipelines (CSS/JSON/TS) and CI jobs  
- **Design team** — validates semantic mappings and approves changes impacting visual identity
- **QA team** — monitors visual regressions and compliance metrics

---

## Change and deprecation process

1. **Open a PR** with description, category, and assigned owner.  
2. **Run automated validations** (schema validation, breaking-change detection, token-aware lint).  
3. **Review and approval** by category owners and the design team when applicable.  
4. **Merge and release**: publish artifacts `src/substrata.css`, `tokens.json`, `substrata.d.ts` (roadmap).  
5. **Deprecation**: mark tokens as `deprecated` in files and changelog; maintain compatibility for **at least two releases** before removal.

---

## Release artifacts

**Current**
- **src/substrata.css** — tokens as CSS Custom Properties  
- **tokens.json** — tokens in JSON for tools and agents (generated by `build:tokens`)  
- **Release notes** — change history and deprecation instructions  

**Roadmap** (see [CI.md](CI.md))
- **substrata.d.ts** — TypeScript declaration files for app consumption  
- **design-contract.json** — mapping between tokens and design tools (e.g. Figma); not yet implemented

---

## Recommended CI and automation

### Essential jobs

- **build:tokens** — generate CSS/JSON/TS from the canonical source  
- **lint:tokens** — validate schema and detect breaking changes  
- **lint:code** — detect hardcoded values outside the token whitelist  
- **refactor:agent** (optional) — run approved automated refactors  
- **visual-regression** — ensure replacements do not alter appearance  
- **audit-log** — record generations and refactors for review

### Design synchronization (roadmap)

- **design-contract.json** — planned artifact to map tokens to Figma styles (token → value → design reference). Not yet implemented; when available, designers will use it to align code and design. See [CI.md](CI.md) (Canonical inputs and outputs).

### Example CI job

```yaml
name: Tokens CI

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/tokens/**'
      - 'package.json'

jobs:
  build-tokens:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build:tokens # generates tokens.json; CSS is in src/substrata.css
      - run: npm run test:tokens  # validates schema and breaking changes

  validate-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-tokens
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint:tokens-check # detects hardcoded values in PRs
      - run: npm run visual-regression
